# Trees for Travel
## Track the Carbon Footprint of your Flights

Trees for Travel is an app to calculate and store the carbon footprint of the flights you take. Enter your origin and destination and the app will calculate an estimated carbon footprint and provide a visual representation of how many trees you'd need to plant to offset it. You can review individual statistics for your flights as well as find information on how to donate to different environmental causes.

Trees for Travel can calculate the carbon footprint of distances between over 13,000 cities worldwide based on the estimate carbon emissions of a Boeing 747 at 80% capacity. All calculations can be easily adjusted within the code.
